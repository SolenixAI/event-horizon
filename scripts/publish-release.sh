# publish-release.sh - publish a Sparkle auto-update for the just-built, notarized
# Event Horizon bundle. PROMPT-FREE from any session: the EdDSA key comes from the
# signing creds file (scripts/signing-creds.sh), GitHub from the gh token. Called
# by `make release-publish` AFTER `make dist` (so the bundle is Developer-ID
# signed, notarized, stapled, and a DMG already exists in <dist-dir>).
#
# Steps: ZIP the notarized bundle → EdDSA-sign the ZIP → create/upload the GitHub
# release on the public repo → insert the item into the Pages-hosted appcast.xml.
# (The public repo itself is the GPLv3 corresponding source, at the release tag.)
#
# Args: <short-version> <build-number> <app-path> <dist-dir> <releases-repo>
