        // that the host's camera-zoom mapping amplified into wild zooming.
        // That cap punished legitimate input:
        // macOS scroll acceleration reports a fast wheel spin as multi-line
        // deltas per event, which the clamp flattened to one line each - fast
        // scrolling crawled no matter how hard the wheel was spun. Scroll now
        // passes through at its reported magnitude.
        //
        // Unit normalisation (required for clean pass-through once the cap is
        // gone): wheel mice report scrollingDelta in LINES; precise devices
        // (trackpads, Magic Mouse, smooth-scroll drivers) report PIXELS,
        // which would overshoot ~10× fed raw into the line-based WHEEL_DELTA
        // scale. SDL's macOS backend (SDL_cocoamouse.m) converts precise
        // deltas at 0.1 pixels→lines - the exact values moonlight-qt's
        // non-Darwin path forwards as preciseY * 120 - so use the same
        // factor. Sub-half-unit results round to zero and are skipped (the
        // wire can't carry them; the next event in a momentum tail carries
        // fresh magnitude, so nothing accumulates wrongly).
        //
        // Whole notches for precise devices: a trackpad arrives as 40-100 unit
