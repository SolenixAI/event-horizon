//  StreamWindow's cursor-visibility ownership and the single foreground
//  re-engage. The CGDisplay hide/show latch (single source of truth =
//  `didHideCursor`), the per-view transparent-cursor backstop, and the one
//  method both return-to-foreground paths funnel through. Split out of
//  StreamWindow.swift to keep each unit focused; see that file for the

    /// off-content no-ops and leaves a stuck arrow on the stream. The
    /// CGDisplay pair is also a counted latch, but it does NOT require the
    /// cursor to be over our window, so the race disappears. This is the same
    /// recipe SDL uses for relative mouse mode on macOS (CGDisplayHideCursor
    /// while the cursor stays associated).
    ///
    /// A hide always re-hides: macOS re-shows the pointer for menu bar and
    /// menu tracking without telling us, and a same-app panel taking key never
    /// runs the background path, so "already hidden" cannot be trusted. A show
    /// undoes every outstanding hide, so nothing is ever stranded invisible.

    /// WindowServer is a separate process compositing on its OWN vsync cadence -
    /// it samples cursor state in the gap between the two CG calls and composites
    /// a frame with the arrow visible. That was the flash. Setting an invisible

    /// Why this exists: there are TWO return paths and they MUST be identical.

    ///       observer calls this.
    ///   (b) The launcher "Back to stream" / menubar CTA → `resumeWindow()`
    ///       calls `makeKeyAndOrderFront` and then this DIRECTLY. The menubar
    ///       path does not reliably re-fire `didBecomeKey` (the launcher window
    ///       is already key when the user clicks, and ordering the stream
    ///       window front from an already-active app can resolve key status
    ///       synchronously inside makeKeyAndOrderFront without posting a fresh
    ///       notification) - so the cursor-hide latch that path (a) re-engages

    ///       (the cursor-model-adjacent bug). Funnelling both paths through this one
    ///       method makes them indistinguishable.

    /// `didHideCursor`, so calling this when the cursor is already hidden
    /// (e.g. didBecomeKey fired AND resumeWindow called it) is a no-op for the
