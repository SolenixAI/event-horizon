//  StreamWindow.swift
//
//  Fullscreen NSWindow hosting the AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer that
//  VideoDecoder enqueues decoded sample buffers into. Owned by StreamSession.
//  Captures the cursor while frontmost, releases it when the user invokes
//  the quit hotkey.
//
//  Why AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer and not CAMetalLayer
//  ---------------------------------------------------
//  We tried - three times - to get correct HDR out of a CAMetalLayer driven
//  by a custom MSL fragment shader doing BT.2020 NCL YUV→RGB + range
//  scaling. On the a 4K@240 HDR1000 panel, every variant landed somewhere
//  on the same wrong axis: overbright midtones, washed highlights, milky
//  blacks. moonlight-qt on the same display, host, and content shows inky
//  blacks and proper bright highlights.
//
//  The reason: on macOS, moonlight-qt's HDR-correct path is not
//  `vt_metal.mm` (its Metal-shader fallback). The default macOS path is
//  `vt_avsamplelayer.mm`, which sidesteps Metal entirely. It hands the OS a
//  CVPixelBuffer wrapped in a CMSampleBuffer and lets AVFoundation +
//  CoreAnimation do colorspace conversion, PQ EOTF application, and EDR
//  tone-mapping against the display's actual peak luminance. There is no
//  shader. There is no manual CSC. The OS owns the pipeline end-to-end.
//
//  When you write PQ-encoded BT.2020 codes into a CAMetalLayer with a
//  custom shader, even with all the right metadata (itur_2100_PQ
//  colorspace, EDRMetadata, wantsExtendedDynamicRangeContent), the
//  compositor still has to reverse-engineer what the shader did. The
//  AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer path skips that round trip: the
//  CVPixelBuffer carries primaries / transfer / matrix attachments,
//  the CMFormatDescription carries mastering-display + content-light
//  metadata, and the layer's colorspace tells the compositor exactly
//  how to interpret the bits. No guesswork, no shader-vs-OS fight.
//
//  This is the same architectural choice moonlight-qt made on macOS and
//  the reason their HDR output is correct on the same panel.
//
//  Full screen has two paths, picked in show() by `coversNotch`. A (default):
//  a borderless window at mainMenuWindow + 1 with [.hideMenuBar, .hideDock] and
//  no Space. B: a Space via toggleFullScreen with the auto-hide options.
