//  EnetControlChannel.swift
//
//  A focused, single-peer, client-only ENet subset over NWConnection(UDP) for
//  the Moonlight CONTROL channel. NOT a full ENet port - only what is needed to
//  reach "connected": the CONNECT handshake, VERIFY_CONNECT validation + ACK,
//  and reliable SEND_RELIABLE for START_A / START_B (encrypted control-V2).
//
//  Transport ported from moonlight-common-c (GPLv3); see CREDITS.md. Source:
//  vendored enet (protocol.h / host.c / protocol.c) + ControlStream.c. The
//  enet protocol logic originates from the enet project by Lee Salzman
//  (MIT License, Copyright (c) 2002-2024 Lee Salzman) - notice preserved in
//  CREDITS.md as the MIT license requires.
//
//  WIRE FACTS (all confirmed against the C source):
//   - ALL multi-byte ENet fields are BIG-ENDIAN (htons/htonl) EXCEPT connectID,
//     which is passed RAW and compared un-byteswapped.
//   - NO CRC trailer and NO compression (moonlight sets neither).
//   - ProtocolHeader is variable length: 2 bytes (peerID only) when SENT_TIME
//     is clear, 4 bytes (peerID + sentTime) when set. SENT_TIME is set on any
//     datagram carrying an ack-flagged or ACK command.
//   - peerID field packs: low 12 bits peer id, bits 12-13 sessionID, bits 14-15
//     flags. Session bits are OR'd in only AFTER outgoingPeerID < 0xFFF (i.e.
//     only after VERIFY_CONNECT) - NOT on the CONNECT we send.
//   - CommandHeader: u8 command (low 4 bits number, bit7 ACK, bit6 UNSEQ),
//     u8 channelID, u16 reliableSequenceNumber (BE).
//   - reliableSequenceNumber is PER-CHANNEL, pre-incremented: first reliable on
//     a channel = 1. CONNECT (channel 0xFF) uses the peer counter → 1.
//     START_A → channel 0 seq 1, START_B → channel 0 seq 2.
//
//  The implementation is split across cohesive extensions to keep each unit
//  focused: this file holds the type, its stored state, and small accessors;
//  EnetControlChannel+Handshake.swift drives CONNECT → VERIFY_CONNECT → START_A/B;
//  EnetControlChannel+ControlLoop.swift runs the post-START keepalive loop;
//  EnetControlChannel+Inbound.swift parses inbound datagrams; and
//  EnetControlChannel+Send.swift holds the outbound send + client→host control.
