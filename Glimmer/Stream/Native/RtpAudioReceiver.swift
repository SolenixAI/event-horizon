//
//  RtpAudioReceiver.swift
//
//  Owns the audio UDP flow for the Swift-native backend: ONE UNCONNECTED POSIX
//  UDP socket (bind a wildcard ephemeral local port; NEVER connect()) used for
//  BOTH the periodic ping (sendto host:audioPort) and RTP receive (recvfrom from
//  ANY source). The host sources audio RTP from a port != audioPort and aims it
//  at the ping's UDP source port, so a *connected* NWConnection would silently
//  drop audio - exactly the bug VideoRtpReceiver was built to avoid. This MIRRORS
//  VideoRtpReceiver's socket/ping pattern. Source: AudioStream.c
//  (AudioReceiveThreadProc + AudioPingThreadProc) + RtpAudioQueue.c.
//
//  Transport ported from moonlight-common-c (GPLv3); see CREDITS.md.
//
//  PING (AudioStream.c:38-65): a 20-byte SS_PING, SETUP-audio's 16-byte X-SS-Ping-Payload then a big-endian
//  sequence number from 1: a fast-start burst, then EnvSignalController's steady cadence. Sunshine aims audio
//  at the ping's source port only once it has one, so ping and receive MUST share one socket.
//
//  RECEIVE (AudioStream.c:239-383): drop runts (< 12 bytes), byteswap the RTP header, feed the queue and
//  decode, AES-CBC decrypting first when SS_ENC_AUDIO is on. A backlog-aware startup gate replaces the C's
//  fixed 500ms drop, which cost live audio because Sunshine paces audio from seq ~0 (see the gate docs).
//
//  Teardown is bounded: stop() only raises the stop flag. The receive loop polls it every 100ms
//  (SO_RCVTIMEO) and the ping thread every wake; each holds the receiver while it uses the fd,
//  so deinit closes it once, after both have exited, as VideoRtpReceiver does.
