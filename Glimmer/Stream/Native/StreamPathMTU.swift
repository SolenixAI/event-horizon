//
//  StreamPathMTU.swift
//
//  CONNECT-TIME PATH PROBE for the video packet-size decision.
//
//  WHY THIS EXISTS: `StreamConfig.packetSize` ships the moonlight-qt LAN default
//  (1392), and `SdpBuilder.build` was written to clamp the ADVERTISED size back
//  to 1024 on a remote session so a full RTP datagram fits inside common VPN
//  path MTUs. That clamp was dead code: it tests `streamingRemotely == 1`
//  (STREAM_CFG_REMOTE) but `StreamConfig.remoteness` defaults to `.auto`
//  (STREAM_CFG_AUTO = 2) and nothing ever resolved it, so EVERY session - LAN or
//  tunnelled - advertised 1392. On a 1280-MTU tunnel (Tailscale/WireGuard
//  default) 1392 + RTP/UDP/IP + tunnel encapsulation overruns the path, so every
//  video packet is IP-fragmented: lose either fragment and the whole packet is
//  gone, which multiplies the pre-FEC loss rate the host's fixed parity then has
//  to absorb. This probe resolves `.auto` from the actual egress route so the
//  clamp fires where it was always meant to.
//
//  HOW: the same throwaway connected-UDP-socket trick `StreamRouteProbe` uses
//  for `stream_link` - connect() on UDP sends NOTHING, it only asks the kernel
//  to bind a route - then getsockname() for the kernel-chosen local address and
//  getifaddrs() for the interface that owns it. The AF_LINK entry for that same
//  interface carries `if_data.ifi_mtu`, so the MTU comes from the one walk we
//  already do. No DNS (the address is the IP literal RTSP already resolved), no
//  ioctl, no privileged call.
//
//  DELIBERATELY NOT `StreamRouteProbe`: that probe is telemetry-gated (built
//  only by the exporter), runs on its own queue, and re-probes for the life of
//  the session. This one is a single always-live syscall burst at the connect
//  edge, because the packet-size decision is a PROTOCOL decision that has to be
//  made before the SDP is built - it has to work with telemetry off.
//
//  DO NO HARM: a full-MTU (>=1500) non-tunnel route resolves to `.local` and
//  every advertised value is byte-identical to before. Only a tunnelled or
//  reduced-MTU path changes, and only ever downward.
