    // SDL ASSOCIATE-FALSE CURSOR MODEL (P0 mouse-snap fix). This is
    // the SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(true) recipe on macOS and is the airtight
    // root-cause fix for the in-game aim snapping to a screen edge/corner.
    //
    // Visibility is owned ENTIRELY by StreamWindow (hide via CGDisplayHideCursor,
    // single source of truth = StreamWindow.didHideCursor). The input layer here
    // owns relative-aim engagement (now including the associate-false latch),
    // gesture suppression, and never touches cursor VISIBILITY (that's
    // StreamWindow's).
    //
    // Why associate-false (and why the prior warp-to-centre model was the bug):
    //   * The previous "reconciled" model kept the cursor ASSOCIATED (the OS
    //     keeps physically moving it) and warped it back to centre when it
    //     neared a screen edge. An associate-TRUE warp posts a reconciling
    //     mouse-moved event whose kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y carries the FULL
    //     edge→centre jump (up to ~1500px on a 3024-wide panel). There was NO
    //     post-warp suppression anywhere, so that reconciliation delta was read
    //     as pure HID motion and sent to the host → the in-game aim snapped to
    //     an edge/corner. Intermittent because it only leaked when a warp's
    //     reconciliation event landed in the motion pipeline.
    //   * Under associate-false the OS STOPS moving the on-screen cursor. There
    //     is therefore no edge to warp from, no warp at all, and no
    //     reconciliation delta to suppress - the entire bug CLASS is structurally
    //     gone. This is exactly what moonlight-qt/SDL do (SDL_cocoamouse).
    //   * The two reasons the prior associate-false attempt was abandoned no
    //     longer apply: (a) "the cursor freezes visibly" - it's hidden by
    //     CGDisplayHideCursor, so there is no visible pointer to freeze; the
    //     user only ever sees in-game aim driven by relative deltas. (b) "the OS
    //     stops reporting deltas" - that was true of NSEvent.deltaX/Y, but we
    //     read kCGMouseEventDeltaX/Y off the CGEvent layer (mouseDelta(from:)),
    //     which stays valid AND becomes pure accel-free HID under associate-false
    //     (the exact field SDL reads in relative mode).
    //   * Every associate-FALSE is paired with a guaranteed associate-TRUE on
    //     resign-key / teardown so Cmd-Tab and stream-end always restore a
    //     normal, OS-controlled pointer.
    //
    // Gesture suppression: the local monitor below eats pinch, smart zoom, swipe and rotate; the cursor can't reach a
    // hot corner under associate-false; Zoom's ⌥⌘8/=/- reach the PC only while ⌘ shortcuts go to the game. Ctrl+scroll
    // Zoom is interlocked below NSEvent and needs the session event tap the diagnostic-tap comment scopes (not installed).
